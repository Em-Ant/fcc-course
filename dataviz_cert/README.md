# freeCodeCamp Challenges for the Data Visualization Certification
### Algorithm and Interactive Projects

This is a local copy of my solutions to the problems for the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map) **Data Visualization Certification** course.

**I have completed this Certification** so these solutions are to be considered stable.

The basic challenges are not stored here, You can find them on my FCC [profile](http://www.freecodecamp.com/em-ant).

All the Interactive Projects are also published on my [Codepen](http://codepen.io/Em-Ant/).

This section is divided in two branches:

* **React Projects** - Interactive Apps build with ReactJs
* **DataViz Projects** - Data Visualiztion Apps build with D3Js
