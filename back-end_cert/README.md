# freeCodeCamp Challenges for the Back End Development Certification
### Bonfire, Ziplines and Node.js based tutorials

This is a local copy of my solutions to  problems and algorithms (Upper Intermediate and Advanced) for the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map) **Back End Development Certification**.

Only algorithm and solutions to the Node based interactive tutorials are stored here. My solutions to the other basic challenges can be found on my FCC [profile](http://www.freecodecamp.com/em-ant).

The advanced Dynamic Web Apps and API Services projects are hosted on Heroku, and have their own repositories. You can find the links to the completed challenges on the file **BACKEND.md**.
