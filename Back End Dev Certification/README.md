# freeCodeCamp Challenges for the Back End Development Certification
### Bonfire, Ziplines and Node.js based tutorials

This is a local copy of my solutions to the basic and intermediate problems(*Waypoints*, and *Bonfires*) for the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map) **Back End Development Certification**. 

Only the solutions to the Node based interactive tutorials are stored here. My solutions for the other basic *Waypoints* can be found on my FCC [profile](http://www.freecodecamp.com/em-ant). 

The advanced Dynamic Web Apps and API Services projects and services (*Basejumps*) will be hosted on Heroku, and will have their own repositories.

Currently I am still working on this Certification.
