# FreeCodeCamp Ziplines
### Intermediate front-end challenges

This is a local copy of my solutions for the front-end development projects for the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map) course.
These projects are also published on my [Codepen](http://codepen.io/Em-Ant/) profile.

The image resources are provided  in a local `./img` folder, where needed. The external JS libraries, and CSS components are linked via CDN, so you have to be connected to the Web to use the projects without any modification. 

The external libraries needed for almost every project are :

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* Various fonts from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

and

* [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/) with the CSS base theme only for the *Wikipedia Viewer*
* [WeatherIcons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) for the *Show the Local Weather* app.
