# freeCodeCamp Challenges for the Front End Development Certification
### Algorithm and Interactive Projects

This is a local copy of my solutions to the problems for the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map) **Front End Development Certification** course.

**I have completed this Certification** so these solutions are to be considered stable.

The basic challenges are not stored here, You can find them on my FCC [profile](http://www.freecodecamp.com/em-ant).

All the Interactive Projects are also published on my [Codepen](http://codepen.io/Em-Ant/).

The external libraries needed for almost every Project are :

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* Various fonts from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

and

* [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/) with the CSS base theme only for the *Wikipedia Viewer*
* [WeatherIcons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) for the *Show the Local Weather* app.
