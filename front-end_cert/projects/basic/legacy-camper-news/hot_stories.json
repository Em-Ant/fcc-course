People start coding app interfaces for health application with web technologies, people start connecting health services to the web, and people also rely on websites for their own safety. And that’s why I think we should feel responsible for our users. And by making choices that are ethical and user-centered, we create a better web for everyone.","description":"undefined","rank":1,"upVotes":[{"upVotedBy":"56ad2aaf3020c7a74e7043de","upVotedByUsername":"mikesprague"}],"author":{"picture":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/560705?v=3","userId":"56ad2aaf3020c7a74e7043de","username":"mikesprague"},"image":"https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vector-networks-opt.png","storyLink":"web
