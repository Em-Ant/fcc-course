# FreeCodeCamp Challenges
### Bonfire, Ziplines and Node.js based tutorials

This is a local copy of my solutions for the basic - intermediate challenges for the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map) course.
The advanced full-stack projects (*Basejumps*) will be hosted on Heroku, and will have their own repositories. 

All the *Bonfires* solutions are reported in a single file. Maybe in the future I'll give them a better structure.

The solutions to the front-end challenges (*Ziplines*) have their own folder. They are also published on my [Codepen](http://codepen.io/Em-Ant/) profile. The image resources needed for are them provided  in local `./img` folders, where needed. The external JS libraries, and CSS components are linked via CDN, so you have to be connected to the Web to use the projects without any modification. 

The external libraries needed for almost every project in the *Ziplines* are :

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* Various fonts from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

and

* [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/) with the CSS base theme only for the *Wikipedia Viewer*
* [WeatherIcons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) for the *Show the Local Weather* app.

The node based tutorial solutions have their own folders, and separate javascript files, which pass the automated tests in the tutorials.
