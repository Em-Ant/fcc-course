# FreeCodeCamp.com Course

This is a local copy of my solutions to the  problems for the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map) course.


The basic *Waypoints* are not stored here, You can find them on my FCC [profile](http://www.freecodecamp.com/em-ant).

All the Interactive Projects (*Ziplines*) are also published on my [Codepen](http://codepen.io/Em-Ant/).

The advanced Dynamic Web Apps and API Services projects (*Basejumps*) are hosted on Heroku, and have their own repositories. You can find the links to the completed challenges on the file **Back End Dev Certification/BASEJUMPS.md**.
