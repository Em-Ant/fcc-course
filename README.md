# FreeCodeCamp.com Course 

This is a local copy of my solutions to the  problems for the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map) course.


The basic *Waypoints* are not stored here, You can find them on my FCC [profile](http://www.freecodecamp.com/em-ant).

All the Interactive Projects (*Ziplines*) are also published on my [Codepen](http://codepen.io/Em-Ant/).

The advanced Dynamic Web Apps and API Services projects and (*Basejumps*) for the **Back-End Development Certification** will have their own repositories, and will be hosted on Heroku.
